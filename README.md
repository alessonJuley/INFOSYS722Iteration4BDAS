# INFOSYS722Iteration4BDAS
This is the last iteration for my project before creating the research paper. BDAS stands for Big Data Analytics Solutions. Students taking INFOSYS 722 course at the University of Auckland have the option to use GItHub, AWS (EC2/AMI), Jupyter, PySpark, and Spark to complete all phases of the data mining process.
